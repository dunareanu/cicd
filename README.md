# CI/CD
**Declarative Configuration**: Applications are defined as declarative configuration files, typically in YAML format, stored in a Git repository.

**Git as Source of Truth**: The Git repository containing the configuration files is the single source of truth for the desired state of the application.

**Automated Deployments**: Changes to the configuration files are automatically reflected in the live environment through a continuous delivery pipeline.

**Immutable Infrastructure**: The infrastructure is treated as immutable, with updates made by creating new resources rather than modifying existing ones.

**Version Control**: All changes to the application's desired state are version-controlled, allowing for easy rollback and auditing.

**Collaboration and Review**: Multiple stakeholders can collaborate on the application definition and review changes before they are deployed.

**Separation of Concerns**: GitOps separates the concerns of development, operations, and security, making it easier to manage complex applications.

**GitOps** is often used in the context of Kubernetes, where it is used to manage and deploy applications in a Kubernetes cluster.

The **Jenkinsfile** is a important component of Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, as it contains the definitions and configurations for automated builds, tests, and deployments. It allows for version control and collaboration, as the pipeline definitions are stored in the same repository as the code.

This makes it easy to track changes to the pipeline and revert to previous versions if necessary. Additionally, it enables the reuse of pipeline code across multiple projects, leading to more consistent and efficient CI/CD processes.

Overall, the use of a Jenkinsfile helps to standardize and automate the software development process, leading to faster and more reliable software delivery.
